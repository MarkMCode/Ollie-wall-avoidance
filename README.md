# Ollie-wall-avoidance
A JS script which allows the sphero Ollie to collide with and then avoid walls on hard floors.  Change variables at the beginning of the script to suit your needs.

WARNING:
I do not guarantee, nor do I expect, that the code provided in this repository will work as intended with your hardware and environment without the editing of variables.  Read your Sphero product's documentation (manual etc.) before using this code.
